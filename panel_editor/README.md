# Simple Panel Pyscript Editor Example

This is a basic example of an editable [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) application in the PyScript editor. This example is aimed for you to get up and running with Panel and the PyScript editor so you can extend it to your own needs.

Please note that if you are running this example on your own server or locally, you will have to set appropriate headers or use `mini-coi` as described in [Pyscript Web Workers](https://docs.pyscript.net/latest/user-guide/workers/).

For more about using Panel with Pyscript, see [Running Panel in WASM](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/wasm/index.html).
