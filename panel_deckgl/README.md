# NYC Taxi Panel DeckGL Example

This example demonstrates how to use [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and [DeckGL](https://deck.gl/) to create a web-based dashboard for exploring a large dataset of taxi trips in New York City. The example uses the [NYC Taxi Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) to visualize the pickup and dropoff locations of taxi trips on a map, and to explore the distribution of trip attributes such as trip distance, fare amount, and tip amount.
